# Spaceflight Data: Economical Reusable Vehicles

This repository contains data specifically focused on **reusable** space vehicles and aerospace planes that represent **economical** options in the spaceflight industry. The data now includes new entries and 3D models for some vehicles.

## Data Organization

The data is organized by company/organization into separate directories (e.g., `spacex/`, `landspace/`). Within each company directory, you will find:

*   A JavaScript file (e.g., `spacex.js`) containing structured data about the company's relevant vehicles. This file exports the data as a JavaScript object.
*   An `imgs/` subdirectory containing related 2D images.
*   For some companies (like SpaceX and Rocketlab), a `models/` subdirectory containing 3D models of vehicles in `.glb` format.

This structure is maintained by LLMs.
