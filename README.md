# Spaceflight Data: Economical Reusable Vehicles

This repository contains data specifically focused on **reusable** space vehicles and aerospace planes that represent **economical** options in the spaceflight industry.

## Data Organization

The data is organized by company/organization into separate directories (e.g., `spacex/`, `landspace/`). Within each company directory, you will find:

*   A JSON file (e.g., `spacex.json`) containing structured data about the company's relevant vehicles.
*   An `imgs/` subdirectory containing related images.

This structure is maintained by LLMs.
